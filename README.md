# cnot.io

This is the source for <https://cnot.io>. This was created years ago before I knew about modern web development, please don't judge me by this code quality; I'm only putting this in a public repo so I can host it with GitHub pages. I wrote the straight HTML by hand and scanned in hand-drawn illustrations.
